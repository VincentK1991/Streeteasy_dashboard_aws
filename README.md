# Interactive Visualization Breaking Down Price, Sizes, and Amenities of NYC Apartment


I used Dash/Plotly to visualize the renting data, including price, location, cost of amenities, and how long it takes to get rented since the apartment is listed.
The data is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

# Why Interactive Dashboard?

The interactive daskboard here provides an intuitive way to look at the data and get a rough idea about the relationship between factors that influence prices. For renters, this may help them decide whether the price of an apartment they are interested in is too high compared to other apartments. For landlords this may help them decide how to price their apartments and how much each amentity item can bump up the price.
